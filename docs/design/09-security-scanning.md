# 09 — Security scanning

Requirements §23 (R-310 – R-320). This document is how the score is produced, stored, enforced and
undone.

---

## 1. The shape of it

A scan is a **fact about one spec revision and the image built from it**, produced by an adapter,
stored append-only beside the app, and read by three places: the planner, the reconciler, and the
console.

```
deploy ──▶ build ──▶ scan ──▶ score ──▶ plan check ──▶ run
                       │                    │
on demand ─────────────┘                    └── refuse: PLAN_SECURITY_BELOW_THRESHOLD
policy change ──────────────────────────▶ re-evaluate the stored score, never rescan
```

**[D] A policy change re-evaluates; it never rescans.** Lowering the threshold must not queue a scan
of every app on the host, and the score of a revision does not change because the rule changed.

**[D] The scan does not gate the build.** It runs after the image exists, because the image is what
it has to look at, and because a build that succeeded is worth keeping even when its result is not
deployable.

---

## 2. The adapter (R-317)

A seventh adapter category, in `adapter/api`:

```go
type Scanner interface {
    Adapter
    Scan(ctx context.Context, req ScanRequest) (ScanResult, error)
    ScannerCapabilities() ScannerCapabilities
}

type ScanRequest struct {
    AppID    string
    SpecID   string
    Image    string // what was built, when there is one
    SourceDir string // the checkout, for scanners that read the tree
}

type ScanResult struct {
    Findings []Finding
    Scanner  string // what produced it, and at what version
    Ran      time.Time
}

type Finding struct {
    ID       string   // CVE-2024-…, or the rule that fired
    Severity Severity // critical | high | medium | low | unknown
    Title    string
    Target   string   // the package, file or layer it is in
    Fix      string   // the version that fixes it, when the scanner knows
}
```

**[D] Severity is Pando's vocabulary, not the scanner's.** Every scanner has its own scale and its
own extra levels; the adapter maps into these five and the score arithmetic never sees a string it
has not defined. `unknown` scores as `low` and is shown as unknown — inventing a severity for a
finding whose severity nobody has decided is how a score stops meaning anything.

**[P] The first adapter is Trivy**, in a container, with no daemon and no socket: it reads the image
from the local runtime and the source from a directory bind. It reports vulnerable dependencies,
leaked secrets and misconfiguration. Static analysis of the app's own code is **O-19** — a different
class of tool, per-language and noisy, and a score that swings on lint opinions is a score people
learn to ignore.

**[D] The scanner is not given the app's secrets, its network, or its volumes.** It sees an image and
a checkout. A component that scans untrusted code is the last component that should hold anything.

---

## 3. The score (R-313)

```
score = max(0, 100 − 25·critical − 10·high − 3·medium − 1·(low + unknown))
```

Deliberately not an average, a ratio, or a curve: one critical finding costs more than fifty low
ones, and the number a threshold is set against does not move because an app grew.

**[D] A scan taken before there was a revision still belongs to the app.** Detection scans the
checkout before a spec exists, so that scan has no revision — and accepting the proposal pins one. A
lookup that insisted on the pinned revision answered "this app has not been scanned yet" a minute
after scanning the very source that revision was written from. So the rule is: the newest scan of
this revision, and failing that the newest scan of no revision, and never another revision's. The
console says which of the two it is showing.

**[D] A score belongs to a revision, not to an app.** `app_scans` is append-only, keyed by
`(app_id, spec_id, scanner_ref, ran_at)`, and the app's current score is the newest scan of its
pinned revision. A rollback therefore restores the score of what it rolled back to, with no rescan
and no lag.

**[D] No score is not a score of zero.** Unscanned, unscannable and "scanned and found nothing" are
three different states and the model keeps them apart (R-318).

**[P] A scan stores two numbers** (R-313a): every finding, and only the findings with a fix. Which of
them an installation means is `ignore_unfixable_findings` in host policy, and policy changes without
rescanning — so deriving the second on read would mean re-deriving it for every row of every list.
Both are written when the findings are in hand. A scan from before the second column existed derives
it from its own stored findings, which is exact.

**[D] The filter drives the list as well as the number.** An installation that ignores unfixable
findings does not see them, and the console says why the list is shorter than the scanner's output.

**[D] Findings are stored and served worst first** (R-313b), by severity and then by ID, so the same
scan orders the same way twice.

## 4. Enforcement

### 4.1 At deploy (R-314)

**[D] Scanned once per source, not once per deploy.** A scan records the commit it read. Detection
scans the commit it reads, a person can ask for a scan (`POST /security/scan`), and a deploy of a commit
nobody has scanned scans it — but a deploy of a commit that already has a successful scan uses that one
and says so in the deploy log ("Using the security scan of 3f9a2c1 from …"). The threshold below is
checked either way. The trade: a deploy that reuses the source scan does not also scan the built image's
OS packages, which only a deploy-time scan saw; a new commit, or a scan somebody asks for, still does.

In the planner, beside the other plan-time refusals, so it fails before anything is created:

- Threshold set, scanner configured, newest scan of the revision being deployed is **below** it →
  `PLAN_SECURITY_BELOW_THRESHOLD`, with the score, the threshold and the three findings that cost
  the most in `details`, and a remedy naming both ways forward: fix the findings, or ask whoever
  holds `install.policy.manage`.
- Threshold set, scanner configured, **no scan at all** for that revision → the same refusal with a
  different message: it has never been scanned, and here is how to scan it.
- Threshold set, **no scanner configured** → nothing is refused (R-317). The policy screen says the
  threshold is inert, because a rule that silently blocks everything is worse than a rule that is
  visibly off.
- Scan failed → the previous score stands (R-318).

### 4.2 While running (R-315, R-316)

The reconciler's own pass, not the deploy path, because the trigger is usually neither: a policy
change, or a rescan that found something new in an app nobody has touched for a month.

```
insecure_since = the first time this app was found below the threshold
```

- Found below → set `insecure_since` if unset, warn, notify the owner, audit.
- Found at or above → clear `insecure_since`, audit the recovery.
- `insecure_since` older than the grace, and policy says stop → `desired_state = stopped`, audited
  with the score, the threshold and the grace it was given.

**[D] Stopping is `desired_state = stopped`.** Reversible, survives a restart, and visible in the
console as a stopped app with a reason. Never a delete, never an edit to the app's configuration,
and never `failed` — `failed` is terminal and means the reconciler gave up (R-151), which is not
what happened here.

**[D] The grace is stated in the policy and shown to the owner at the moment it starts.** A deadline
nobody was told about is an outage with extra steps.

## 5. Host policy

Three fields, defaulting to off, following R-272's pattern — a permissive default that policy may
raise:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `min_security_score` | `0` | Below this, a deploy is refused. `0` is off. |
| `insecure_action` | `warn` | `warn` or `stop`. |
| `insecure_grace_hours` | `24` | How long an app has after it is first found insecure, before `stop` applies. |
| `ignore_unfixable_findings` | `false` | Leave findings with no published fix out of the score and out of the list. |

**O-20** is whether a score ages: nothing rescans an app that has not been deployed since, so a
clean score can describe three-week-old vulnerability data. A scheduled rescan is the obvious answer
and needs a decision about what it costs on a small host.

---

## 6. Surfaces

**Console.** The score lives on the app's **overview**, beside the card carrying its status, address
and last deploy — in the column a deploy log used to occupy. The score is a property of what is
running, and the person who has to act on it is the one reading that page; a log is a history and
belongs with the other histories on the Logs tab. The section carries the mark, the counts, when it was taken, every finding, and **Scan now**.
It is not in settings: settings is where an app is configured, and a score is not a setting.

The **apps list** carries the same mark, at `score / 100`, beside status — which is the question a
list is for: which of these needs me.

**[D] The score is a shield and a number, together** (R-320). The shield carries the color and the
number carries the fact; neither appears without the other. Color is the second signal, never the
only one:
"F" tells a deployer nothing they can act on, and a red pill tells somebody who cannot see red
nothing at all. The color says what the number means *here* — against the installation's threshold
where one is set, and against bands where none is, because a score of 20 is worth noticing on an
installation that enforces nothing.

Host policy's screen carries the three fields, with the consequence written at the point of setting
them.

**API.** `GET /apps/{id}/security` for the current score and findings, `POST /apps/{id}/security/scan`
to take a new one. Both behind `app.view` and `app.deploy` respectively — asking for a scan changes
what a deploy will do, so it is not a read.

**[P] A scan in progress is reported, whoever started it** (issue #68). A scan can take a minute,
and a deploy, detection, the CLI, MCP or the console can start one. The report carries
`scanning_since` while a scan of the app runs, and each row of `GET /apps` carries
`security_scanning`, so every client shows the same state rather than only the one that asked
(R-261). The console shows it as the design system's *building* status, the hollow ring, in the
Security section and the list's Security column, and polls while it lasts. Onboarding already has
its own step for the scan (the `scanning` detection stage).

The state is held in memory by the security service, not in `app_scans`. That table is append-only
and records what a scan found (R-319), and an unfinished scan has found nothing yet. A scan also
ends when the process running it ends, so a stored "running" row would be left behind by a restart.
An in-memory marker can't be left behind. It depends on Pando running as a single server process,
which it does. Two scans of one app at once, such as a deploy's and a **Scan now**, count as one
running scan until the last of them ends.

**CLI and MCP.** They follow from the API without further design (R-261); the MCP tool is a read,
because an agent asking Pando to rescan until it passes is a loop nobody wants.

## 7. What the first implementation does, and does not

**Three moments, and each scans what exists at it.**

- **Detection**, while the checkout is still on disk. An app that has been added
  and not yet deployed has no image, and waiting for one means the first thing
  anybody sees about a new app is "not scanned yet" — when a committed key or a
  vulnerable lockfile is exactly what they want to know before deciding to
  deploy it. The scan has no spec revision, because there is no revision yet.
  Never fatal: the proposal is what that run is producing.
- **Deploy**, after the build: the image and the checkout together, against the
  revision being deployed.
- **On demand**, against whatever the app has. A deployed app's newest
  successful image, and for one that has never been built, a fresh checkout —
  fetched for the scan and dropped after it, because a copy of somebody's code
  held between scans is a copy Pando is responsible for, and a clone on a button
  press is a cost the person pressing it chose. Host policy's source allowlist
  is checked again before the clone (R-092), because it can change between
  creation and now.

**The scanner is seeded on and enforces nothing.** A fresh installation gets
Trivy as its default scanner, so every deploy produces a score — and
`min_security_score` defaults to 0, so nothing is refused until an administrator
sets one (R-270). A score nobody has is a score nobody acts on, and a threshold
nobody chose is an installation that cannot deploy.

**The scanner's handoff is a file, not a socket.** Pando saves the image with
the runtime it already has a socket for, and copies the tar into the scanner's
own filesystem. Two things were learned building it:

- A source file's mode travels through a tar. A checkout copied in at 0600
  owned by a host uid was unreadable inside the scanner, which reported a clean
  tree — a pass nobody earned, and the worst failure this component has. Modes
  and ownership are normalized on the way in.
- The category had to reach the database. `adapter_configs.category` carries a
  CHECK enumerating the categories, and seeding the default scanner against a
  schema that had never heard of `scanner` failed at startup, on every restart.
  Migration 000016 is that fix; the lesson is in 000010's comment already and is
  worth repeating: a category that exists only in Go is a category no adapter
  can be configured in.

**Not built yet.** A scheduled rescan (O-20), static analysis of the app's own
code (O-19), and the plan-time half of R-314 — `POST /apps/{id}/plan` does not
yet report the standing, so a below-threshold app is refused when its deploy
reaches the scan rather than at `:plan`. The refusal is the same error with the
same detail either way; what is missing is the earlier warning.
