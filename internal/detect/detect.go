// Package detect works out how to build and run an app from its source.
//
// Two rules shape everything here. R-102: ask, never guess — an uncertain
// detector returns a question, not a plausible default. R-021: fill declared
// slots, never invent topology — if the repo does not say it needs a database,
// Pando does not go hunting through imports to decide that it does.
//
// The auction (R-093) exists so the user can see how the answer was reached.
// Every detector bids, the bids are ranked, and the runners-up are returned
// alongside the winner — a verdict with its reasoning, rather than a verdict.
