// R-096: a compose file is a complete answer, not a hint. The author already
// said what runs, in what order, with which volumes and healthchecks — so this
// imports it rather than treating it as evidence for a guess.
//
// R-099 is the other half. Some compose constructs cannot survive the boundary
// Pando puts around an app, and this returns one of two outcomes for each:
//
//	rejected  — PLAN_COMPOSE_CONSTRUCT_REJECTED, naming the service and the

//	rewritten — imported with different mechanism and the same behavior, and
//	            a WARN_COMPOSE_CONSTRUCT_REWRITTEN saying exactly what changed.
//
// The split is not about severity. It is about whether the app still does what
// its author meant afterwards. Publishing a host port is a mechanism Pando
// replaces with its own routing and the app is still reachable, so it is
// rewritten. `privileged: true` has no replacement that keeps the isolation the
// rest of the system depends on, so it is refused.
