// that is the only network its workloads are on and nothing publishes a port
// (R-134). There is no code here that could accidentally expose it.
//
// Its data is in a Pando volume, so it is recorded, backed up with the app,
// carried in the DR bundle, offered at delete and reclaimed afterwards — all by
// machinery that already exists and knows nothing about services (R-135).
