// R-094 tier 3 named this first: `.github/workflows` contains the maintainer's
// own build commands.
//
// It ranks at the top of the ladder for a reason that has nothing to do with
// parsing being easy. A Makefile target is what somebody wrote down; a workflow
// step is what runs on every push, and has been observed to work by every green
// check on the repository. When the two disagree, the workflow is the one that
// is true.
//
// The reading is deliberately timid, because the ways to be wrong here are
// worse than not answering. A workflow file is a program: matrices, conditional
// steps, reusable workflows, composite actions, and commands assembled from
// expressions. None of that is interpreted. What is taken is the `run:` steps
// of a single unambiguous build job, and anything that makes "single" or
// "unambiguous" false is declined — at which point the repository is planned by
// whatever the next source down says, exactly as it was before.

// jobPattern matches a job key: two spaces of indent under `jobs:`.
