// A Procfile says how an app is run, and R-094 names it in tier 2 among the
// explicit deployment artifacts.
//
// It does not say how the app is *built*, which is why it ranks where it does:
// above the embed pairing, which knows an ordering and no commands, and below
// the runners, which know both. What it contributes is a start command, and
// nixpacks still plans the build.

// `web` is the process type Pando wants. Everything else in the file is another
// process, and R-021 is clear that Pando does not invent topology: a repository
// that declares a worker has not asked for one to be deployed, and turning its
// Procfile into two workloads would be reading the file as a request rather
// than as a description of what it can run.
