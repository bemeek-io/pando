// A Makefile is the maintainer saying how their app is built.
//
// R-094's confidence ladder puts "the maintainer's own build commands" above
// ecosystem manifests, and this is why: convention-matching reads a repository
// and guesses, while a Makefile target is the answer written down by the person
// who wrote the app. macscout is the case that made it concrete — a Go module
// at the root whose Makefile builds a React client into `cmd/server/dist` and
// then embeds it with `go:embed`. Convention-matching sees go.mod, plans
// `go build`, and produces a binary that starts, reports healthy and serves an
// empty page, because the placeholder that makes `go:embed` compile on a fresh
// clone is all that ends up inside it.
//
// Nothing here synthesizes a Dockerfile. R-095 says to wrap a buildpack
// implementation rather than reimplement convention-matching, and that still
// holds: nixpacks decides the environment, and what this adds is the commands
// it should run inside it. `--build-cmd`, `--start-cmd` and `--pkgs` are its
// own flags.

//
// Its own pattern because Go's regexp has no lookahead, so "a colon not
// followed by =" cannot be spelled inside targetPattern: its trailing `[^=]?`
// is optional, and an optional match of nothing accepts the `=` it was meant to
// exclude. A Makefile with a variable named after a target therefore read as
// declaring that target, and the plan ran `make build` against something that
// does not exist. Shared with the justfile reader, whose `name := value` has
