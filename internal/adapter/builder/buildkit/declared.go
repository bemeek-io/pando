// What a repository says about how it is built, and how much that is worth.
//
// R-094's ladder is a ladder of evidence, and everything here sits on it. The
// bottom rung is convention-matching: nixpacks reads a repository and infers,
// which is a guess that is usually right. Every source above it is the app's
// author saying something, and the difference is not confidence in the abstract
// — it is whether being wrong is a bug in Pando or a mistake in the repository.
//
// Ranked, highest first, with the requirement each one answers to:
//
//	workflow   .github/workflows — the commands CI actually runs      R-094 tier 3
//	runner     Makefile, Taskfile.yml, justfile — named commands      R-094 tier 3
//	procfile   Procfile — the run command                             R-094 tier 2
//	embedded   two declarations naming one directory                  see below
//
// `embedded` is the odd one and the reason this file exists. Nothing in a repo
// like macscout-without-a-Makefile says "build the client first" — but
// `web/vite.config.ts` says its output goes to `../cmd/server/dist`, and
// `cmd/server/main.go` says `//go:embed all:dist`. Two files, written by the
// same person for different reasons, naming one directory from opposite ends.
// Reading that pair is not inference; it is joining two declarations. It ranks
// below the sources that name commands because it says an *ordering* and not a
// command — it knows the client must be built first, and has to be told by
// nixpacks what "the build" it comes before actually is.

// rank orders declaration sources. Higher wins.
