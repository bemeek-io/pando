// A repair gets the whole closed set. Answering questions gets a schema of its
// own: one kind, and a key that must be one of the questions actually asked,
// with every field required. Core refuses anything else from that call
// regardless (R-336), but the answer schema used to be the general one, where
// "key" is optional because most kinds have none — and a model answered the
// build_strategy question correctly with no key at all, so the answer was
// refused and the person was asked anyway.
//
// Answering also fills the values the deploy waits on (api.ScreenRequest.
// Values): a second shape, set_env, whose key must be one of those. Each shape
// is offered only when it has keys, so an empty enum never reaches the API.
