// The eighth category, added in phase 9. It reverses an earlier decision that a
// destination was a byte sink rather than a category — design 03 §8.1 records
// the reversal and what the old argument got right. The short reason it is a
// category: an object store expires and versions objects on its own schedule
// and a filesystem path does not, so who owns retention is a real question with
// a real wrong answer, and R-254 says a question like that is answered by a
// capabilities struct rather than by a type assertion.
//
// Bundles are opaque here. The adapter never sees plaintext: encryption happens
// in core under a passphrase supplied at backup time (R-213), so a destination
// that is compromised yields ciphertext and a manifest-shaped blob.
