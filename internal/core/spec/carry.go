// Carrying a person's decisions across a re-detection.
//
// R-022 makes re-detection explicit and says it shows a diff against the
// pinned spec. What it does not say — and what accepting one used to do — is
// replace that spec wholesale. So somebody who deployed an app, set a few
// environment variables, chose how its database was filled, then added a
// Dockerfile and re-detected, lost all three the moment they accepted. The app
// kept running on the old spec, the data was still on disk, and the next deploy
// quietly started something configured differently.
//
// The rule is the one WithAnswers already states for answers: a decision a
// person made is worth more than anything Pando worked out for itself. Which
// decisions those are is not a guess — the spec already records provenance on
// ports (Port.Source), volumes (Volume.Declared) and now environment entries
// (EnvEntry.Source), because this is exactly the question those fields exist to
// answer.
//
// What deliberately does not carry: the build block, the workload set, and
// anything sourced from a file that was read again. Re-detecting *is* the
// request to take those from the repository, and a merge that preserved them
// would make re-detection do nothing.

// Carry returns next with the decisions a person made in pinned preserved.
//
// pinned may be nil, which is the first acceptance: there is nothing to carry
// and the proposal stands as it is.
