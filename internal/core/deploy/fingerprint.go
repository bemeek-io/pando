// EnvFingerprint summarizes the environment an app was applied with.
//
// This is the whole mechanism behind R-193 — "a rotated secret reaches the app"
// — and it exists because `Observe` returns no environment and deliberately
// never will. Reading environment back would require every runtime adapter to
// handle secret-bearing data, which is precisely what WorkloadPlan.Env's
// one-way flow is designed to prevent. So the comparison happens state-side:
// what was applied, against what would be applied now.
//
// **It hashes secret versions, never secret values.** A fingerprint is stored
// in a column, shown in logs when it changes, and survives in backups. Hashing
// the value would put an oracle for every secret in the app into all three —
// an attacker with the column and a guess could confirm the guess. Hashing
// (key, version) answers the only question being asked, which is whether the
// thing changed, and answers nothing else.
