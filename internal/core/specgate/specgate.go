// Package specgate decides whether somebody may write a spec revision, for the
// parts of a spec that app.spec.edit alone does not cover: an app's egress
// rules (R-182 – R-184) and automatic deploys on an app whose deploys need
// approval (R-158).
//
// One function, called by every path that writes a revision from content the
// caller supplied, so that no surface — console, CLI, MCP — can save a spec
// another surface would refuse (R-261). Paths that copy the pinned spec and
// change something else (routing, resources, a pinned commit) carry its egress
// and auto-deploy settings unchanged and need nothing from here.
