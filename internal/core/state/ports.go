// Ports allocates the host ports that port-mode routing hands out.
//
// [P] — unspecified in the requirements. R-166 prefers subdomain and falls back
// to path, and the loopback adapter that ships as the laptop default supports
// neither: it is port mode only. So an install using it has to get a port from
// somewhere, and nothing said where. See docs/plan/open-decisions.md O-15.
//
// The rule is the lowest free port in a configured range. Not random, so an app
// keeps its port across a rebuild and a bookmark keeps working; reused rather
// than ever-increasing, so a deleted app's port comes back.
//
// It is a row in a table rather than a number derived from existing specs. The
// derived version raced: detection runs in the background per app, and three
// apps added together had two of them compute the same "lowest free" port
// before either had written anything down. A unique constraint cannot be raced
// — one writer wins and the other is told — which is the same reason every
// other invariant here lives in the schema.
