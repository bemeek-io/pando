// feature is split across.

// Reading the score is `app.view`: it is a fact about an app somebody can
// already see, and the person who has to fix a finding is usually not the
// person who can deploy. Asking for a new scan is `app.deploy`, because the
// score decides whether the next deploy is allowed — which makes it a write
// however much it looks like a refresh.
